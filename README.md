### 🤖 Transformer Models

Deep dive into modern NLP with fine-tuned and pre-trained transformer models.

- 📈 **Fine-Tune BERT for Sentiment Analysis**  
  Fine-tuning BERT on IMDb movie reviews for binary sentiment classification.

- ✍️ **Text Generation with GPT-2**  
  Generate human-like text using GPT-2 with decoding strategies like greedy search and beam search.

- 🧠 **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**  
  Leverage zero-shot classification using models like `facebook/bart-large-mnli` to infer textual entailment for multiple labels.

- 🧠 **Semantic Search with Sentence Transformers**  
  This project uses **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** to build a semantic search system by encoding text into dense vector embeddings. It retrieves the most relevant results for a user query using cosine similarity.
